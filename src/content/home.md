    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It  has
    roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
    2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
    College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
    consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the
    word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.


    Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of “de Finibus  Bonorum et Malorum” (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..”, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
